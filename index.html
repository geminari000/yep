  <title>Sample Website #1</title>
  <body>
    <h1> my first Website</h1>
    <p>Hello World! This is my first website.
    <p>Here is another paragraph of text
    <hr>
    <p>And here is another one.
    Notice that spacing doesn't matter.
    Everything is printed on one line on the page.
    Even though in the code, these are all seperate lines.
    <p>If you want a new line you need another paragraph tag
    <p> like here
    <hr>
  </body>
</html>
